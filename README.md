# React Hooks: useMemo, useCallback, and useRef

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the use of advanced React hooks: `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `useRef`. These hooks are essential for optimizing performance in React applications by preventing unnecessary re-renders and managing references to DOM elements or values that persist across renders.

### Features

- **useMemo:** Used for memoizing expensive calculations, ensuring they only re-run when necessary.
- **useCallback:** Used to memoize callback functions, ensuring that they only change when their dependencies do.
- **useRef:** Used to maintain persistent references to DOM elements or values across renders without causing re-renders.
